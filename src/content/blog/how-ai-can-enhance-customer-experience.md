# How AI can enhance customer experience

As AI technologies mature and become more accessible, companies are increasingly integrating them into their products. As customer experience (CX) is increasingly driving revenue, executives are actively pushing teams to incorporate. Two areas where AI is contributing significantly are personalization and customer journey. CX leaders are using or piloting AI to personalize their customer experience, and to understand pain points in the customer journey.

AI is more than just chatbots, it can empower employees, revolutionize services and personalize experiences.

## How to successfully lead AI implementation

1.  Assess your current AI implementation - Evaluate where you're already using AI in your CX operations. Are you only using chatbots, or have you expanded to other areas? Identify gaps where AI could potentially improve customer interactions or employee efficiency.

2.  Prioritize high-impact AI use cases - Figure out where AI can be most useful, such as areas requiring a lot of manual effort. Consider implementing AI for customer journey management, predictive routing, sentiment and empathy analysis, agent assistance, or employee coaching. These areas are currently underutilized by most organizations and offer significant potential for improving both customer and employee experiences (and are areas where AI can be particularly valuable).

3.  Set clear goals and expectations - Define what success looks like for your AI initiatives. This could include metrics like increased customer satisfaction, reduced handle times and improved employee engagement. Consider how your metrics need to evolve to reflect both traditional CX metrics and ones that reflect how a better experience impacts the entire business. Ensure these goals align with your overall CX strategy.

4.  Plan for proactive service - Given that 72% of CX leaders believe AI will drive all proactive service outreach in the future, start planning how you can use AI to anticipate customer needs and each out proactively. This could involve analyzing customer behavior patterns or product usage data to predict when a customer might need assistance.

5.  Evaluate your data readiness - Clean, structured data --- and massive amounts of it --- are essential for AI systems. Engage with your team (and vendors) to address any concerns, providing training and clear communication to build support and alleviate fears. Do the same with any externally sourced data.

6.  Build meaningful use cases for customer journey -- tapping the transformative power of AI requires more than simply deploying a set of tools. It means seizing the opportunity AI creates to meaningfully improve the customer and employee experience --- and drive better business outcomes. choose what matters most to the customer and select

7.  Training and enablement - Create a robust training curriculum that not only teaches employees how to use AI tools but also helps them understand the strategic importance of AI in improving customer experiences. This will help alleviate fears about job security and position AI as a partner in their work rather than a threat.
