					<h3>Global Enterprise CCaaS Migration & Infrastructure Consolidation</h3>
					<span class="tags">Cloud Migration • Genesys • Healthcare • Fortune 500</span>

						<li><strong>Strategic Outcome:</strong> Standardized global customer service operations onto a single "Golden Image" architecture, reducing technical debt and improving global agent mobility by 40%.</li>
						<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Directed a cross-functional delivery team and partner sales organizations to co-sell and implement a unified SIP/WebRTC networking layer, ensuring E911 and STIR/SHAKEN regulatory compliance.</li>

					<h3>AI-Driven Transformation for a Rapid-Growth Startup</h3>
					<span class="tags">Conversational AI • Intelligent Routing • CRM Integration • Startup</span>
					<p>Engineered an "AI-First" customer care roadmap for a bootstrapped financial startup to scale operations without a proportional increase in headcount.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Architected a self-service-first model using Conversational AI and Intelligent Routing, which deflected 65% of Tier-1 inquiries and allowed the startup to support a 300% increase in user volume with zero additional hiring.</li>
						<li><strong>Strategic Outcome:</strong> Integrated Agent Assist and Sentiment Analytics into the existing CRM, increasing upsell conversion rates by 22% by providing agents with real-time "Next Best Action" data.</li>

					<h3>Strategic Consulting & Roadmap Development for an Uncertain Retailer</h3>
					<span class="tags">Strategic Advisory • Avaya Migration • TCO Optimization • Retail</span>
					<p>Spearheaded a Strategic Advisory for a multi-billion dollar retailer paralyzed by the perceived risk and high capital requirements of migrating a 2,500-seat legacy on-premise Avaya environment.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Conducted a "Cost of Inaction" (COI) forensic audit, surfacing $850k in annual "hidden" maintenance debt and redundant carrier spend; leveraged these findings to build a self-funding financial model that reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by 22%.</li>
						<li><strong>Strategic Outcome:</strong> Benchmarked legacy KPIs (62% FCR / 7:15 AHT) against AI-first CCaaS standards, architecting a three-phase "Crawl-Walk-Run" roadmap that prioritized high-impact digital channels first to mitigate operational risk and secure C-suite buy-in.</li>
						<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Orchestrated a "Visioning Workshop" for the CFO and COO, translating complex technical architectures into a multi-year business value narrative that realized $3.8M in verified bottom-line impact through improved agent utilization and automated channel containment.</li>
